# ShieldHer 🚨🤖

## Overview

**ShieldHer** is a smart AI-powered women safety system that provides instant emergency assistance using voice activation and multi-layered hardware triggering. It is designed to help women quickly alert their emergency contacts and share real-time location during dangerous situations.

When a distress trigger is activated (via voice or hardware), the system immediately:

* Sends emergency SMS alerts
* Makes emergency calls to saved contacts
* Shares live GPS location
* Activates hardware-based emergency trigger system

This project combines **IoT + AI + Full Stack Development** to build a real-time safety solution.

## Key Features

* 🎙️ Voice-triggered emergency activation
* 📍 Real-time GPS location tracking
* 📞 Automatic emergency calls to contacts
* 💬 Instant SMS alerts with live location link
* 🔗 Multi-layer safety activation (software + hardware)
* ⚡ Fast response using ESP32 microcontroller

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
* React.js
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Backend
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB (Database)

### Hardware / IoT
* ESP32 microcontroller
* GPS Module (for live location tracking)
* GSM Module (for SMS & calling functionality)

### Communication
* Twilio API is integrated in the backend
* Sends SMS alerts and makes calls via internet

## System Architecture

1. User triggers emergency (voice command or hardware button)
2. ESP32 detects trigger signal
3. GPS module fetches current location
4. GSM module sends SMS & makes calls
5. Backend logs event and manages user/contact data
6. Frontend dashboard displays user info and emergency status
